<h1>My First UI/UX Redesign Project Experience</h1>
Redesigning a website or app is a challenging task compared to designing something from scratch because redesign is not all about changing the User Interface, it’s about solving the problems in existing design.

<h3><b>1. Start finding flaws in existing design</b></h3>
Redesigning an existing design is complicated because you need to study complete design to find flaws. So start with the user flow, try to analyze the user flow of the existing design, and after that start checking the UX part of the design and try to make it better. At last, after all the things you need to check the UI in the design.
If you can’t find flaws in the existing design then try to ask users where they are feeling troubled.

<h3><b>2. Fix the flaws with UX laws</b></h3>
If you want to fix the designs you need to have a piece of knowledge of UX laws. Try to meet the user’s needs and easy accessibility and the important thing is don’t think as a designer, you need to think like a user to reach the user's expectations. Always create a clear hierarchy and make it easy to understand to users.

<h3><b>3. Study all the similar apps</b></h3>
Don’t just concentrate on redesigning your app but you need to make it better than all other similar existing Apps. Suppose if you are redesigning an e-commerce app then try to study the all leading e-commerce apps and write down the main points to make your design better and stand out from all other apps. Try to find out the magic things in their apps that are attracting the users.

<h3><b>4. Break down the components and design better</b></h3>
Break down the elements that are present on the screen and start making it better. Redesigning is all about breaking down the existing things and designing them better. Replace the old stuff with new trends.

<h3><b>5. Important points to consider while designing the UI in the Redesign.</b></h3>
Use the best typography pairs which are trending.
Research about color combinations before you use them.
Always use the same family icons or the same group of icons all around the app.
Place your CTA’s correctly and make sure you make a difference between priority buttons and non-priority buttons.
Design for both Dark mode and light mode.
Make use of design trends like glassmorphism, gradient cards, etc
Redesigning with the new trends always gives your app a new life.

<h3><b>6. Don’t stop experimentation and optimization</b></h3>
Never stop iterating the process of Implementing the new stuff and testing it. This will bring new and best results out of your design and make your design stand out from similar apps.
